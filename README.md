# DCS autorestart script
Script to auto restart the mission after 10 hours of playtime

<ins>How it works?</ins>
- The script is called each time a player is leaving the server.
- When the 10 hours are done, the script will check if players are still online.
- When the last player is disconnecting (after the 10 hours), the script reboot the mission

<ins>What I ask in exchange?</ins>
- Mention a small credit to me in your server/mission :) 

<ins>How to install it?</ins>
- shutdown your server
- download the file
- put it here > C:\Users\yourNickname\Saved Games\DCS.openbeta\Scripts\Hooks
- start your server
- enjoy ðŸ™‚
